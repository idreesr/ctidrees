== Instructions for Use ==

Options Page
This theme comes with an Options Page located under 'Appearance -> Theme Options' in the WordPress Dashboard. This page allows the user to customize the theme through a selection of settings. Simply select an option of your choice from the ones available and click 'Save Changes' to observe the change on your live site.

Enhanced Customization
This theme comes with a custom home page that includes an image slider. To use this custom page, create a new page and apply the 'Custom Home Page' template to it before setting that page as the new homepage. To change the posts that appear in the image slider, simply tag your four desired posts with the tag 'Featured' (make sure that it has the slug 'featured') and make sure to set a featured image for each as well. The featured images will appear on the slider.
